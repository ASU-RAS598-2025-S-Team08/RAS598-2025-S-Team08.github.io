## 📦 Autonomous Patrol in Action

This video demonstrates the TurtleBot4 autonomously navigating through a custom warehouse simulation built in Gazebo. The robot performs a full patrol loop using Nav2, reacts to obstacles, and follows predefined waypoints. You’ll see:
- Live SLAM-based navigation
- Dynamic re-planning when paths are blocked
- Accurate localization 
- Integration of sensor data for robust movement

## 🖥️ GUI Real-Time Sensor Data (Live Demo Progress)

This video showcases the real-time graphical user interface (GUI) developed to monitor and control the robot’s patrol behavior. The GUI includes:
- LiDAR scan visualization
- Current patrol zone mapping
- Anomaly flagging and logging
- Status updates: battery level, distance, alerts
